This is a prototype using something similar to https://github.com/vercel/ai/tree/main/examples/next-openai

This prototype attempts to have the AI talk to itself, for non-productive and entertainment purposes. That isn't to say that it will remain non-productive.

If you want to run this locally checkout the repo, update the environment variable file, and run npm run dev.

This will be open source as this is a fun side project and will be entertaining to see in what direction AI will take itself if it is not stuck in a loop.
